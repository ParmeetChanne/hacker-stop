## About Us
I, Parmeet, gained interest in hacking after watching a YouTube video, but the more I wanted to learn about the field, the more I realized that even though there are free resources available, they are scattered everywhere. It was difficult to find a place with all available resources to learn say XSS. 
So after a few months of gaining learning experience in cybersecurity, I created HackerStop.

HackerStop is a non-profit organization aimed at centralizing and organizing free resources from the internet for individuals interested in cybersecurity. Our mission is to empower aspiring ethical hackers, bug bounty hunters, and security enthusiasts with the necessary knowledge and tools to excel in this field.
